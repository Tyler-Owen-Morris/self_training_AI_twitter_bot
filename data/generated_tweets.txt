====================
Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign, has the authority to investigate whether any other President has violated the Constitution. This includes the Espionage Act and the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

The Trump administration has repeatedly said it will not prosecute any individuals or organizations who work against the interests of the United States or its allies.

In the past, the White House has invoked the Espionage Act, the Foreign Agents Registration Act, and the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act to prosecute individuals or groups who are accused of violating the provisions of the Espionage Act.

The Trump administration has drawn the attention of the media after sending a letter to the FBI investigating the possible Trump campaign collusion with Russia.

The letter was signed by DOJ attorney general, Jeff Sessions, and US Attorney for the Northern District of California, Preet Bharara.

"We are occasionally asked by the media to intervene in foreign intelligence and counterintelligence investigations. In this case, we are not doing that. We are doing the same thing as we would do in a criminal case, which is to remain in our role as independent prosecutors and to enforce the laws we are sworn to uphold," said Bharara.

The letter states that "the department is not prosecuting or seeking to prosecute anyone under the Espionage Act or the Foreign Agents Registration Act, and we are not currently investigating any other individuals or organizations for violations of those statutes."

The letter went on to say, "We are not in a position to comment on the merits of the case or any other particular actions by the Justice Department. We are simply in a position to say that if you're investigating, as we are, a matter which is so important to the United States, that the Justice Department is doing its job and we are not doing anything else."

Bharara's office is a division of the DOJ that has a stated objective of "protecting the integrity of

Robert Mueller said it was "always a little bit of a concern" that the FBI was not releasing more information during the Russia probes.

"I think that the Department of Justice has been quite slow to release all of the emails that they have collected when we last looked at the Russian matter, and that is something that we always have been concerned about," Mueller said.

"The fact that we missed it last time, that's not to say that we are going to miss it again, but it's important that we have some kind of information we can share as far as the scope of the investigation," he added.

Mueller said that the FBI sometimes "even takes a little bit longer than we would allow" to release records to the Justice Department.

"We do maintain a printout of the materials once we have them, but until we have them we are not able to release them," he said.

Mueller also mentioned the FBI's "not a fan" of the release of records to the Justice Department, but said that could change "over time."

"I personally think that we should have the opportunity to make a case as to why we should be releasing or should be releasing, and then the administration will make a decision on whether or not to make that case," he said.

The director said he met with Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Thursday and expressed his concerns that the FBI was not releasing more material to the Justice Department.

Mueller said that on one occasion Lynch called him and "I said, 'Mr. Chairman, I believe we should be releasing this information, but I want to know as a matter of policy, you should be able to keep it,' and that's something I would like to see happen as well."

Mueller was speaking at the annual meeting of the American Enterprise Institute, which is sponsored by the conservative Heritage Foundation.

Mueller was also expected to announce an initiative that

Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election meddling as well as civil rights violations in the U.S. is basically over.

In a remarkable twist, the Justice Department has decided to drop its investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, a decision the Justice Department said was the result of "the removal of the investigation from its scope and intent."

The decision by the Justice Department to drop the investigation is a big one.

The case was submitted to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, but it has been rejected by Judge William O. Thomas who wrote in his majority opinion that "The Court rejects the US government's decision to drop a fraud investigation into Michael Flynn."

The court also reaffirmed the previous decision by the U.S. District Court that the investigation into Flynn was unlawful.

The decision came after the Justice Department announced on March 10 that it has dropped the investigation into Flynn after "the removal of the investigation from its scope and intent."

Thomas said that the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) had concluded in a report that "the removal of the investigation from its scope and intent" was "the result of a change in the scope and intent of the investigation."

Thomas said that the OIG's decision was not "a final decision" but that "the OIG did not mean to conclude that a fraud investigation was not being conducted."

The court also saw the OIG's conclusion that the decision to drop the Flynn case was the result of the "pending dismissal of the fraud investigation, for which the OIG is continuing to investigate."

The decision is a huge blow for the Flynn case, and a huge blow to the White House as the case is now being dismissed by the House after the Trump administration's decision.

The decision to drop the investigation was a surprise to many as a number of lawmakers had said that they were "trou

Robert Mueller and his team have been trying to gather evidence against the Obama administration in the ongoing Russia probe.

In recent weeks, it has emerged how Mueller's team looked into the case of a Russian-American businessman who was convicted in 2015 of money laundering for the Russian state.

The case appeared to be a one-off, however, and was ultimately found to be a cover-up by the Obama administration.

Mueller's team alleged that the money transfer was a "pilot" operation of a Russian law firm set up by the company, Oleg Deripaska, which also had ties to the Obama administration.

Mueller's team also alleged that the Oleg Deripaska lawyer had been in contact with a Russian embassy official to discuss the scheme, the Washington Post reported.

Former FBI agents have repeatedly called on Mueller to drop the investigation into the case.

It is not known whether the investigation is ongoing.

The criminal case against Oleg Deripaska is said to be the latest in a series of Russian-American cases which have seen the Obama administration accused of having connections to the Russian state.

A Russian-American businessman has been accused of laundering $30m (£20m) through a company set up by the US-based Oleg Deripaska.

The case against Oleg Deripaska was first brought by the US government in 2008.

The former Russian-American businessman was convicted in 2015 of charges relating to money laundering, conspiracy and fraud.

Mr Deripaska was convicted of money laundering and conspiracy relating to illegal activities and was sentenced to 20 years in prison.

He, along with other Russian-Americans, was sentenced to 20
